My still WIP new and improved responsive portfolio.

I've included my group project as well as two other applications.

I've also switched my bootstrap framework for [Materialize Css](https://materializecss.com/about.html)


Credit for my parallax image goes to [Lexi Lauwers](https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photo-of-city-2921140/) a gorgeous free-to-use photo of Toronto, Canada.
